## Changing Properties of Game Objects {#changing-properties-of-game-objects}

Different game objects will behave in different ways, and some of them will need you to tell them how to behave. For example, the story point is already programmed to display a message in your game, but to customise that message you need to open the game objectâ€™s properties.

To open its properties, right-click on the game object in your level, and select **Edit Instance Properties** (instance is another word for a single object).

The properties window will pop up, and it will show you properties you can set for this game object. The properties you see will depend on the game object. Make sure to click Save Properties when you are done.
